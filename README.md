# My Personal Website
### My very first website

Yo, welcome to the repo for my personal website! ðŸš€ This is where I showcase my digital self using just plain ol' HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript.

## What's Inside?

- **index.html**: The brain of the operation, where my story unfolds.
- **style.css**: The stylist making sure everything looks fly.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript maestro, adding some interactive spice.

Feel free to jump in, remix, or add your own flair to these files.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
2. Get to know the coolest person on the web (spoiler: it's me ðŸ˜Ž).
